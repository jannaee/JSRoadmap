#JS ROADMAP Outline was created by Zell Liew (https://zellwk.com/). I created an answer set below to test my JavaScript knowledge. 

## Phase 1

### Phase one objectives to master

#### 1. How do you declare variables?
Variables are declared using the keywords var, let, const. They can have a value set to them or not.


#### 2. What are Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null and Undefined?
    Strings - used to store a series of characters can me any characted inside a single or double quote

    Numbers - intergers that can be written with or without decimals

    Booleans - a data type that evaluates to either true or false
    
    Null - a data type that is nothing but is actually an object, the typeof is object
        extra tip: you can empty and object by setting it to null
    
    Undefined - a variable without a value, the typeof is undefined 
        extra: any value can be emptied by setting the value to undefined

#### 3. What are Arrays, Objects and Functions?
>    Arrays - an object used to store multiple values, and uses numbers to access it's elements
~~~
Example:
    Create an array - var array_cars = ['saab', 'ford', ...]
    Access an array - var name = cars [0] (using indexing)

~~~
>    Object - is a construct that stores multiple values in a key/value pairing. it uses names to access it's members

> Functions are a logical way to store a block of code
#### 4. How to use if and else statements?
    - [ ] *

#### 5. How to compare variables?
    - [ ] *

#### 6. How to use the for loop?
> Loops are handy for when you want to execute the same block of code over and over but get different values each time. An example:

    ~~~
    
    ~~~

### Phase one testing

- [ ] 1. What are the five primitive values in JavaScript? 
    * Primitives are values with no properties
    * Null, Strings, Number, Undefined, Booleans, Symbol (ES6)

- [ ] 2. How do you declare and assign variables in JavaScript?
    * Declare variables using a keyword var let or const paired with a name
    * Assign or initialize by setting that name with a value using an '=' sign on the RHS with any of the 6 primitive values
    
- [ ] 3. What's the difference between const, let and var?
    * var is the original keyword to create variables, but has become outdated since release of ES6, but difficult to manage hoisting during scoping
    * let introcudes block scope, where the variable is only accessible within the block of code it was introduced into 
    * const it's like let, but you cannot reassign it a value
        * use to minimize mutable state
        * 

- [x] 4. What do each of the following operators do?
    1. ```+``` //add
    2. ```-``` //subtract
    3. ```*``` //multiply
    4. ```/``` //divide
    5. ```%``` //allow something to not have a remainder

- [x] 5. What do each of the following comparison operators do?

    1. ``` === ```//strict comparision, must match in type and value
    2. ```!==``` //is not equal to
    3. ```>``` //greater than
    4. ```>=``` //greater than or equal to
    5. ```<``` //less than
    6. ```<=``` //less than or equal to


- [x] 6. How do you use the following conditionals?
  1. if 
  > if (expression to evaluate to true){ code to execute if the condition is true}
  
  2. if else
  > if (condition to evaluate to true){block to return if it is}else{if condition did not turn to be true this block is exectued}
    
   3. else
   > can be used for specifying an additional condition if the first is false 
   
- [ ] 7. How do you use a for loop?
    ~~~
    for (let i = 0; i<4; i++){
        block of data to be looped through
    }
    ~~~~

- [ ] 8. What is an array?
    > Arrays is a type of object that stores a list of data in bracket notation. It's best to chose this data type with you want the element names to be numbers.

- [ ] 9. How do you put values into arrays?
    > Set it to a variable and add data in as strings or numbers surronded by brackets
    
    > You can add data into an array by identifiying the index to be replaced and setting it to a new value like below:
    ~~~
    var cars=['toyota'];
    cars[0] = 'bmw'
    console.log(cars) //bmw
    ~~~

    > You can also use the push method to put items into array:
    ~~~
    car.push('ford')
    ~~~

- [ ] 10. How to you get values out of arrays?
        
        Use bracket notation, Arrays start with a 0 index. refer to the array's name and pair it with the index you want to get, or all data by denoting the var name

- [ ]11. How do you remove a value from an array?
       > * pop or shift removes the laster and first elements of an array respectively
        ~~~
        var fruits = ['orange','kiwi', 'strawberry']
        ~~~

- [ ] 12. How do you loop through every value of an array?
    > The best way is to use a for loop:
    ~~~
        Example: 
            let fruits, 
            fruitsLength, 
            i;

            fruits = ['apple', 'starfruit', 'orange'];
            fruitsLength = fruits.length;
            for (i=0; i < fruitsLength; i++) {
                console.log( fruits[i] )
            }
    ~~~

- [ ] 13. What is an object?
> Definition: Use objects when you want elements names to be strings

* 1. How do you put values into objects?
~~~
One way is to create the object literally
    let car = {
        type: 'scion', 
        color: 'teal', 
        model:"200"
    }

Add new properties 
    car.year = "1998"; //best to use with you know the name of the property
    car[age] = "30" //best to use when you know the name of the property is dynamic
    console.log(car); 
    //
~~~

* 2. How do you get values out from objects?
~~~
    console.log(car.type); //'scion'
~~~
* 3. How do you remove a property from an object?
* 4. How do you loop through every value of an object?
    > Using ES6 a for...of loop will work
    ~~~
    Example:
        for (const key of Object.keys(obj)) {
            console.log(key, obj[key])
        }
    ~~~
    > Using ES5 a Object.keys() 
    ~~~
    Example:
        var obj = {first: "Jannaee", last:"Sick"};

        Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key){
            console.log(key, obj[key]);
        });
    ~~~
